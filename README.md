##Summary

Based on the results of the data analysis I would recommend the following. 

1. Reduce the  number of drivers in urban cities. The average fare per driver is lower in urban cities because there are more drivers than rides. 

2. Reduce the fare per ride in the rural cities. This decrease will help level out the city types and the rates per ride in each city. 

3. Increase the fare per ride in the urban cities. This increase will help level out the city types and the rates per ride in each city.
